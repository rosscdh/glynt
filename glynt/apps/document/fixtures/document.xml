CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND INVENTION ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Consultant Name: {{consultant_name}}

Effective Date: {{date_effective}} 

As a condition of my becoming employed (or my consulting being continued) by {{full_company_name}}, a Delaware corporation, or any of its current or future subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns (collectively, the “&lt;u&gt;Company&lt;/u&gt;”), and in consideration of my consulting relationship with the Company and my receipt of the compensation now and hereafter paid to me by the Company, I agree to the following:

&lt;ol class="levelone"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Relationship.&lt;/strong&gt;  This Agreement will apply to my consulting relationship with the Company.  If that relationship ends and the Company, within a year thereafter, either employs me or engages me as a consultant, I agree that this Agreement will also apply to such later employment or consulting relationship, unless the Company and I otherwise agree in writing.  Any such employment or consulting relationship between the Company and me, whether commenced prior to, upon or after the date of this Agreement, is referred to herein as the “&lt;u&gt;Consulting Relationship.&lt;/u&gt;”
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Duties.&lt;/strong&gt; I will perform for the Company such duties as may be  required pursuant to my Consulting Agreement with the Company referenced above (the “&lt;u&gt;Consulting Agreement&lt;/u&gt;”).
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Confidential Information.&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Protection of Information.&lt;/strong&gt;  I agree, at all times during the term of the Relationship and thereafter, to hold in strictest confidence, and not to use, except for the benefit of the Company to the extent necessary to perform my obligations to the Company under the Relationship, and not to disclose to any person, firm, corporation or other entity, without written authorization from the Company in each instance, any Confidential Information (as defined below) that I obtain, access or create during the term of the Relationship, whether or not during working hours, until such Confidential Information becomes publicly and widely known and made generally available through no wrongful act of mine or of others who were under confidentiality obligations as to the item or items involved.  I further agree not to make copies of such Confidential Information except as authorized by the Company.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Confidential Information.&lt;/strong&gt;  I understand that “&lt;u&gt;Confidential Information&lt;/u&gt;” means information and physical material not generally known or available outside the Company and information and physical material entrusted to the Company in confidence by third parties.  Confidential Information includes, without limitation:  (i) Company Inventions (as defined below); (ii) technical data, trade secrets, know-how, research, product or service ideas or plans, software codes and designs, developments, inventions, laboratory notebooks, processes, formulas, techniques, biological materials, mask works, engineering designs and drawings, hardware configuration information, lists of, or information relating to, employees and consultants of the Company (including, but not limited to, the names, contact information, jobs, compensation, and expertise of such employees and consultants), lists of, or information relating to, suppliers and customers (including, but not limited to, customers of the Company on whom I called or with whom I became acquainted during the Relationship), price lists, pricing methodologies, cost data, market share data, marketing plans, licenses, contract information, business plans, financial forecasts, historical financial data, budgets or other business information disclosed to me by the Company either directly or indirectly, whether in writing, electronically, orally, or by observation.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Third Party Information.&lt;/strong&gt;  My agreements in this Section 3 are intended to be for the benefit of the Company and any third party that has entrusted information or physical material to the Company in confidence.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Other Rights.&lt;/strong&gt; This Agreement is intended to supplement, and not to supersede, any rights the Company may have in law or equity with respect to the protection of trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Ownership of Inventions.&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Inventions Retained and Licensed.&lt;/strong&gt;  I have attached hereto, as Exhibit A, a complete list describing with particularity all Inventions (as defined below) that, as of the Effective Date, belong solely to me or belong to me jointly with others, and that relate in any way to any of the Company’s proposed businesses, products or research and development, and which are not assigned to the Company hereunder; or, if no such list is attached, I represent that there are no such Inventions at the time of signing this Agreement.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Use or Incorporation of Inventions.&lt;/strong&gt;  If in the course of the Relationship, I use or incorporate into a product, process or machine any Invention not covered by Section 4(d) of this Agreement in which I have an interest, I will promptly so inform the Company.  Whether or not I give such notice, I hereby irrevocably grant to the Company a nonexclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, assumable, perpetual, worldwide license, with right to transfer and to sublicense, to practice and exploit such Invention and to make, have made, copy, modify, make derivative works of, use, sell, import, and otherwise distribute under all applicable intellectual properties without restriction of any kind.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Inventions.&lt;/strong&gt;  I understand that “&lt;u&gt;Inventions&lt;/u&gt;” means discoveries, developments, concepts, designs, ideas, know how, improvements, inventions, trade secrets and/or original works of authorship, whether or not patentable, copyrightable or otherwise legally protectable.  I understand this includes, but is not limited to, any new product, machine, article of manufacture, biological material, method, procedure, process, technique, use, equipment, device, apparatus, system, compound, formulation, composition of matter, design or configuration of any kind, or any improvement thereon.  I understand that “Company Inventions” means any and all Inventions that I may solely or jointly author, discover, develop, conceive, or reduce to practice during the period of the Relationship, except as otherwise provided in Section 4(g) below.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Assignment of Company Inventions.&lt;/strong&gt;  I agree that I will promptly make full written disclosure to the Company, will hold in trust for the sole right and benefit of the Company, and hereby assign to the Company, or its designee, all my right, title and interest throughout the world in and to any and all Company Inventions.  I further acknowledge that all Company Inventions that are made by me (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of and during the period of the Relationship are “works made for hire” (to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law) and are compensated by my salary.  I hereby waive and irrevocably quitclaim to the Company or its designee any and all claims, of any nature whatsoever, that I now have or may hereafter have for infringement of any and all Company Inventions. 
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance of Records.&lt;/strong&gt;  I agree to keep and maintain adequate and current written records of all Company Inventions made by me (solely or jointly with others) during the term of the Relationship.  The records may be in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, flow charts, electronic data or recordings, laboratory notebooks, or any other format.  The records will be available to and remain the sole property of the Company at all times.  I agree not to remove such records from the Company’s place of business except as expressly permitted by Company policy which may, from time to time, be revised at the sole election of the Company for the purpose of furthering the Company’s business.  I agree to deliver all such records (including any copies thereof) to the Company at the time of termination of the Relationship as provided for in Sections 5 and 6.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Patent and Copyright Rights.&lt;/strong&gt;  I agree to assist the Company, or its designee, at its expense, in every proper way to secure the Company’s, or its designee’s, rights in the Company Inventions and any copyrights, patents, trademarks, mask work rights, moral rights, or other intellectual property rights relating thereto in any and all countries, including the disclosure to the Company or its designee of all pertinent information and data with respect thereto, the execution of all applications, specifications, oaths, assignments, recordations, and all other instruments which the Company or its designee shall deem necessary in order to apply for, obtain, maintain and transfer such rights, or if not transferable, waive such rights, and in order to assign and convey to the Company or its designee, and any successors, assigns and nominees the sole and exclusive right, title and interest in and to such Company Inventions, and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights or other intellectual property rights relating thereto.  I further agree that my obligation to execute or cause to be executed, when it is in my power to do so, any such instrument or papers shall continue during and at all times after the end of the Relationship and until the expiration of the last such intellectual property right to expire in any country of the world.  I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and in my behalf and stead to execute and file any such applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the application for, prosecution, issuance, maintenance or transfer of letters of patents, copyright, mask work and other registrations related to such Company Inventions.  This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall not be affected by my subsequent incapacity.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Exception to Assignments.&lt;/strong&gt;  I understand that the Company Inventions will not include, and the provisions of this Agreement requiring assignment of inventions to the Company do not apply to, any invention which qualifies fully for exclusion under the provisions of applicable state law, if any, attached hereto as Exhibit B.  In order to assist in the determination of which inventions qualify for such exclusion, I will advise the Company promptly in writing, during and after the term of the Relationship, of all Inventions solely or jointly conceived or developed or reduced to practice by me during the period of the Relationship.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Company Property; Returning Company Documents.&lt;/strong&gt;  I acknowledge and agree that I have no expectation of privacy with respect to the Company’s telecommunications, networking or information processing systems (including, without limitation, files, e-mail messages, and voice messages) and that my activity and any files or messages on or using any of those systems may be monitored at any time without notice.  I further agree that any property situated on the Company’s premises and owned by the Company, including disks and other storage media, filing cabinets or other work areas, is subject to inspection by Company personnel at any time with or without notice.  I agree that, at the time of termination of the Relationship, I will deliver to the Company (and will not keep in my possession, recreate or deliver to anyone else) any and all devices, records, data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications, drawings, blueprints, sketches, laboratory notebooks, materials, flow charts, equipment, other documents or property, or reproductions of any of the aforementioned items developed by me pursuant to the Relationship or otherwise belonging to the Company, its successors or assigns.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Termination Certification.&lt;/strong&gt;  In the event of the termination of the Relationship, I agree to sign and deliver the “Termination Certification” attached hereto as Exhibit C; however, my failure to sign and deliver the Termination Certification shall in no way diminish my continuing obligations under this Agreement.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Notice to Third Parties.&lt;/strong&gt;  I understand and agree that the Company may, with or without prior notice to me and during or after the term of the Relationship, notify third parties of my agreements and obligations under this Agreement.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Solicitation of Employees, Consultants and Other Parties.&lt;/strong&gt;  As described above, I acknowledge and agree that the Company's Confidential Information includes information relating to the Company's employees, consultants, customers and others, and that I will not use or disclose such Confidential Information except as authorized by the Company.  I further agree as follows:
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Employees, Consultants.&lt;/strong&gt; I agree that during the term of the Relationship, and for a period of {{nonsolicitation_period}} months immediately following the termination of the Relationship for any reason, whether with or without cause, I shall not either directly or indirectly solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company’s employees or consultants to terminate their relationship with the Company, or attempt to solicit, induce, recruit, encourage or take away employees or consultants of the Company, either for myself or for any other person or entity. 
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Other Parties.&lt;/strong&gt; I agree that during the term of the Relationship, and for a period of {{confidentiality_period}} months immediately following the termination of the Relationship for any reason, whether with or without cause, I shall not use any Confidential Information of the Company to negatively influence any of the Company’s clients or customers from purchasing Company products or services or to solicit or influence or attempt to influence any client, customer or other person either directly or indirectly, to direct any purchase of products and/or services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or other entity in competition with the business of the Company.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;No Change to Duration of Relationship.&lt;/strong&gt;  I understand and acknowledge that this Agreement does not alter, amend or expand upon any rights I may have to continue in the consulting relationship with, or in the duration of my consulting relationship with, the Company under any existing agreements between the Company and me, including without limitation the Consulting Agreement, or under applicable law.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Representations and Covenants.&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Facilitation of Agreement.&lt;/strong&gt;  I agree to execute promptly, both during and after the end of the Relationship, any proper oath, and to verify any proper document, required to carry out the terms of this Agreement, upon the Company’s written request to do so.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;No Conflicts.&lt;/strong&gt;  I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement does not and will not breach any agreement I have entered into, or will enter into, with any third party, including without limitation any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information or materials acquired by me in confidence or in trust prior to or during the Relationship.  I will not disclose to the Company or use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information or material belonging to any previous client, employer or any other party.  I will not induce the Company to use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information, or material belonging to any previous client, employer or any other party.  I acknowledge and agree that I have listed on Exhibit A all agreements (e.g., non-competition agreements, non-solicitation of customers agreements, non-solicitation of employees agreements, confidentiality agreements, inventions agreements, etc.), if any, with a current or former client, employer, or any other person or entity, that may restrict my ability to accept employment with the Company or my ability to recruit or engage customers or service providers on behalf of the Company, or otherwise relate to or restrict my ability to perform my duties for the Company or any obligation I may have to the Company.  I agree not to enter into any written or oral agreement that conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				I further represent that I do not presently perform or intend to perform, during the term of the Consulting Agreement, consulting or other services for, and I am not presently employed by and have no intention of being employed by, companies whose businesses or proposed businesses in any way involve products or services that would be competitive with the Company's products or services, or those products or services proposed or in development by the Company during the term of the Consulting Agreement (except for those companies, if any, listed on Exhibit D attached hereto).  If, however, I decide to do so, I agree that, in advance of accepting such employment or agreeing to perform such services, I will promptly notify the Company in writing, specifying the organization to which I propose to render services, and provide information sufficient to allow the Company to determine if such work would conflict with the interests of the Company.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Voluntary Execution.&lt;/strong&gt;  I certify and acknowledge that I have carefully read all of the provisions of this Agreement, that I understand and have voluntarily accepted such provisions, and that I will fully and faithfully comply with such provisions.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;General Provisions.&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Governing Law.&lt;/strong&gt;  The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws. 
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Entire Agreement.&lt;/strong&gt;  This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Company and me relating to its subject matter and merges all prior discussions between us.  No amendment to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing signed by both parties to this Agreement.  The Company shall not be deemed hereby to have waived any rights or remedies it may have in law or equity, nor to have given any authorizations or waived any of its rights under this Agreement, unless, and only to the extent, it does so by a specific writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company, it being understood that, even if I am an officer of the Company, I will not have authority to give any such authorizations or waivers for the Company under this Agreement without specific approval by the Board of Directors.  Any subsequent change or changes in my duties, obligations, rights or compensation will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Severability.&lt;/strong&gt;  If one or more of the provisions in this Agreement are deemed void or unenforceable to any extent in any context, such provisions shall nevertheless be enforced to the fullest extent allowed by law in that and other contexts, and the validity and force of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected.  In the event that any court or government agency of competent jurisdiction determines that, notwithstanding the terms of the Consulting Agreement specifying my Relationship with the Company as that of an independent contractor, my provision of services to the Company is not as an independent contractor but instead as an employee under the applicable laws, then solely to the extent that such determination is applicable, references in this Agreement to the Relationship between me and the Company shall be interpreted to include an employment relationship, and this Agreement shall not be invalid and unenforceable but shall be read to the fullest extent as may be valid and enforceable under the applicable laws to carry out the intent and purpose of the Agreement.			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Successors and Assigns.&lt;/strong&gt;  This Agreement will be binding upon my heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives, and my successors and assigns, and will be for the benefit of the Company, its successors, and its assigns.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Remedies.&lt;/strong&gt;  I acknowledge and agree that violation of this Agreement by me may cause the Company irreparable harm, and therefore agree that the Company will be entitled to seek extraordinary relief in court, including, but not limited to, temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond or other security (or, where such a bond or security is required, I agree that a $1,000 bond will be adequate), in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Advice of Counsel.&lt;/strong&gt;  I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, IN EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, AND I HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AGAINST ANY PARTY BY REASON OF THE DRAFTING OR PREPARATION HEREOF.
			&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;EXHIBIT B&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Section 2870 of the California Labor Code is as follows:

(a)	Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer’s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those inventions that either:

&lt;ol class="levelone"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer; or
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Result from any work performed by the employee for the employer.
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

(b)	To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to require an employee to assign an invention otherwise excluded from being required to be assigned under subdivision (a), the provision is against the public policy of this state and is unenforceable.] 

&lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt;

RCW 49.44.140 of the Revised Code of Washington is as follows:

(1)	A provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign or offer to assign any of the employee’s rights in an invention to the employer does not apply to an invention for which no equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information of the employer was used and which was developed entirely on the employee’s own time, unless (a) the invention relates (i) directly to the business of the employer, or (ii) to the employer's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (b) the invention results from any work performed by the employee for the employer. Any provision which purports to apply to such an invention is to that extent against the public policy of this state and is to that extent void and unenforceable.

(2)	An employer shall not require a provision made void and unenforceable by subsection (1) of this section as a condition of employment or continuing employment.

(3)	If an employment agreement entered into after September 1, 1979, contains a provision requiring the employee to assign any of the employee’s rights in any invention to the employer, the employer must also, at the time the agreement is made, provide a written notification to the employee that the agreement does not apply to an invention for which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of the employer was used and which was developed entirely on the employee’s own time, unless (a) the invention relates (i) directly to the business of the employer, or (ii) to the employer's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (b) the invention results from any work performed by the employee for the employer.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND INVENTION ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Employee Name: {{employee_name}}

Effective Date: {{date_effective}} 

As a condition of my becoming employed (or my employment being continued) by {{full_company_name}}, a Delaware corporation, or any of its current or future subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns (collectively, the “&lt;u&gt;Company&lt;/u&gt;”), and in consideration of my employment with the Company and my receipt of the compensation now and hereafter paid to me by the Company, I agree to the following:

&lt;ol class="levelone"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Relationship.&lt;/strong&gt;  This Agreement will apply to my employment relationship with the Company.  If that relationship ends and the Company, within a year thereafter, either reemploys me or engages me as a consultant, I agree that this Agreement will also apply to such later employment or consulting relationship, unless the Company and I otherwise agree in writing.  Any such employment or consulting relationship between the Company and me, whether commenced prior to, upon or after the date of this Agreement, is referred to herein as the “&lt;u&gt;Relationship.&lt;/u&gt;”
	&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;strong&gt;Duties.&lt;/strong&gt;  I will perform for the Company such duties as may be  designated by the Company from time to time or that are otherwise within the scope of the Relationship and not contrary to instructions from the Company.  During the Relationship, I will devote my entire best business efforts to the interests of the Company and will not engage in other employment or in any activities detrimental to the best interests of the Company without the prior written consent of the Company.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Confidential Information.&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Protection of Information.&lt;/strong&gt;  I agree, at all times during the term of the Relationship and thereafter, to hold in strictest confidence, and not to use, except for the benefit of the Company to the extent necessary to perform my obligations to the Company under the Relationship, and not to disclose to any person, firm, corporation or other entity, without written authorization from the Company in each instance, any Confidential Information (as defined below) that I obtain, access or create during the term of the Relationship, whether or not during working hours, until such Confidential Information becomes publicly and widely known and made generally available through no wrongful act of mine or of others who were under confidentiality obligations as to the item or items involved.  I further agree not to make copies of such Confidential Information except as authorized by the Company.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Confidential Information.&lt;/strong&gt;  I understand that “&lt;u&gt;Confidential Information&lt;/u&gt;” means information and physical material not generally known or available outside the Company and information and physical material entrusted to the Company in confidence by third parties.  Confidential Information includes, without limitation:  (i) Company Inventions (as defined below); (ii) technical data, trade secrets, know-how, research, product or service ideas or plans, software codes and designs, developments, inventions, laboratory notebooks, processes, formulas, techniques, biological materials, mask works, engineering designs and drawings, hardware configuration information, lists of, or information relating to, employees and consultants of the Company (including, but not limited to, the names, contact information, jobs, compensation, and expertise of such employees and consultants), lists of, or information relating to, suppliers and customers (including, but not limited to, customers of the Company on whom I called or with whom I became acquainted during the Relationship), price lists, pricing methodologies, cost data, market share data, marketing plans, licenses, contract information, business plans, financial forecasts, historical financial data, budgets or other business information disclosed to me by the Company either directly or indirectly, whether in writing, electronically, orally, or by observation.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Third Party Information.&lt;/strong&gt;  My agreements in this Section 3 are intended to be for the benefit of the Company and any third party that has entrusted information or physical material to the Company in confidence.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Other Rights.&lt;/strong&gt; This Agreement is intended to supplement, and not to supersede, any rights the Company may have in law or equity with respect to the protection of trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Ownership of Inventions.&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Inventions Retained and Licensed.&lt;/strong&gt;  I have attached hereto, as Exhibit A, a complete list describing with particularity all Inventions (as defined below) that, as of the Effective Date, belong solely to me or belong to me jointly with others, and that relate in any way to any of the Company’s proposed businesses, products or research and development, and which are not assigned to the Company hereunder; or, if no such list is attached, I represent that there are no such Inventions at the time of signing this Agreement.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Use or Incorporation of Inventions.&lt;/strong&gt;  If in the course of the Relationship, I use or incorporate into a product, process or machine any Invention not covered by Section 4(d) of this Agreement in which I have an interest, I will promptly so inform the Company.  Whether or not I give such notice, I hereby irrevocably grant to the Company a nonexclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, assumable, perpetual, worldwide license, with right to transfer and to sublicense, to practice and exploit such Invention and to make, have made, copy, modify, make derivative works of, use, sell, import, and otherwise distribute under all applicable intellectual properties without restriction of any kind.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Inventions.&lt;/strong&gt;  I understand that “&lt;u&gt;Inventions&lt;/u&gt;” means discoveries, developments, concepts, designs, ideas, know how, improvements, inventions, trade secrets and/or original works of authorship, whether or not patentable, copyrightable or otherwise legally protectable.  I understand this includes, but is not limited to, any new product, machine, article of manufacture, biological material, method, procedure, process, technique, use, equipment, device, apparatus, system, compound, formulation, composition of matter, design or configuration of any kind, or any improvement thereon.  I understand that “Company Inventions” means any and all Inventions that I may solely or jointly author, discover, develop, conceive, or reduce to practice during the period of the Relationship, except as otherwise provided in Section 4(g) below.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Assignment of Company Inventions.&lt;/strong&gt;  I agree that I will promptly make full written disclosure to the Company, will hold in trust for the sole right and benefit of the Company, and hereby assign to the Company, or its designee, all my right, title and interest throughout the world in and to any and all Company Inventions.  I further acknowledge that all Company Inventions that are made by me (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of and during the period of the Relationship are “works made for hire” (to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law) and are compensated by my salary.  I hereby waive and irrevocably quitclaim to the Company or its designee any and all claims, of any nature whatsoever, that I now have or may hereafter have for infringement of any and all Company Inventions. 
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance of Records.&lt;/strong&gt;  I agree to keep and maintain adequate and current written records of all Company Inventions made by me (solely or jointly with others) during the term of the Relationship.  The records may be in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, flow charts, electronic data or recordings, laboratory notebooks, or any other format.  The records will be available to and remain the sole property of the Company at all times.  I agree not to remove such records from the Company’s place of business except as expressly permitted by Company policy which may, from time to time, be revised at the sole election of the Company for the purpose of furthering the Company’s business.  I agree to deliver all such records (including any copies thereof) to the Company at the time of termination of the Relationship as provided for in Sections 5 and 6.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Patent and Copyright Rights.&lt;/strong&gt;  I agree to assist the Company, or its designee, at its expense, in every proper way to secure the Company’s, or its designee’s, rights in the Company Inventions and any copyrights, patents, trademarks, mask work rights, moral rights, or other intellectual property rights relating thereto in any and all countries, including the disclosure to the Company or its designee of all pertinent information and data with respect thereto, the execution of all applications, specifications, oaths, assignments, recordations, and all other instruments which the Company or its designee shall deem necessary in order to apply for, obtain, maintain and transfer such rights, or if not transferable, waive such rights, and in order to assign and convey to the Company or its designee, and any successors, assigns and nominees the sole and exclusive right, title and interest in and to such Company Inventions, and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights or other intellectual property rights relating thereto.  I further agree that my obligation to execute or cause to be executed, when it is in my power to do so, any such instrument or papers shall continue during and at all times after the end of the Relationship and until the expiration of the last such intellectual property right to expire in any country of the world.  I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and in my behalf and stead to execute and file any such applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the application for, prosecution, issuance, maintenance or transfer of letters of patents, copyright, mask work and other registrations related to such Company Inventions.  This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall not be affected by my subsequent incapacity.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Exception to Assignments.&lt;/strong&gt;  I understand that the Company Inventions will not include, and the provisions of this Agreement requiring assignment of inventions to the Company do not apply to, any invention which qualifies fully for exclusion under the provisions of applicable state law, if any, attached hereto as Exhibit B.  In order to assist in the determination of which inventions qualify for such exclusion, I will advise the Company promptly in writing, during and after the term of the Relationship, of all Inventions solely or jointly conceived or developed or reduced to practice by me during the period of the Relationship.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Company Property; Returning Company Documents.&lt;/strong&gt;  I acknowledge and agree that I have no expectation of privacy with respect to the Company’s telecommunications, networking or information processing systems (including, without limitation, files, e-mail messages, and voice messages) and that my activity and any files or messages on or using any of those systems may be monitored at any time without notice.  I further agree that any property situated on the Company’s premises and owned by the Company, including disks and other storage media, filing cabinets or other work areas, is subject to inspection by Company personnel at any time with or without notice.  I agree that, at the time of termination of the Relationship, I will deliver to the Company (and will not keep in my possession, recreate or deliver to anyone else) any and all devices, records, data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications, drawings, blueprints, sketches, laboratory notebooks, materials, flow charts, equipment, other documents or property, or reproductions of any of the aforementioned items developed by me pursuant to the Relationship or otherwise belonging to the Company, its successors or assigns.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Termination Certification.&lt;/strong&gt;  In the event of the termination of the Relationship, I agree to sign and deliver the “Termination Certification” attached hereto as Exhibit C; however, my failure to sign and deliver the Termination Certification shall in no way diminish my continuing obligations under this Agreement.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Notice to Third Parties.&lt;/strong&gt;  I understand and agree that the Company may, with or without prior notice to me and during or after the term of the Relationship, notify third parties of my agreements and obligations under this Agreement.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Solicitation of Employees, Consultants and Other Parties.&lt;/strong&gt;  As described above, I acknowledge and agree that the Company's Confidential Information includes information relating to the Company's employees, consultants, customers and others, and that I will not use or disclose such Confidential Information except as authorized by the Company.  I further agree as follows:
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Employees, Consultants.&lt;/strong&gt; I agree that during the term of the Relationship, and for a period of {{nonsolicitation_period}} months immediately following the termination of the Relationship for any reason, whether with or without cause, I shall not either directly or indirectly solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company’s employees or consultants to terminate their relationship with the Company, or attempt to solicit, induce, recruit, encourage or take away employees or consultants of the Company, either for myself or for any other person or entity. 
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Other Parties.&lt;/strong&gt; I agree that during the term of the Relationship, and for a period of {{confidentiality_period}} months immediately following the termination of the Relationship for any reason, whether with or without cause, I shall not use any Confidential Information of the Company to negatively influence any of the Company’s clients or customers from purchasing Company products or services or to solicit or influence or attempt to influence any client, customer or other person either directly or indirectly, to direct any purchase of products and/or services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or other entity in competition with the business of the Company.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;At-Will Relationship.&lt;/strong&gt;  I understand and acknowledge that, except as may be otherwise explicitly provided in a separate written agreement between the Company and me, my Relationship with the Company is and shall continue to be at-will, as defined under applicable law, meaning that either I or the Company may terminate the Relationship at any time for any reason or no reason, without further obligation or liability, other than those provisions of this Agreement that explicitly survive the termination of the Relationship.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Representations and Covenants.&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Facilitation of Agreement.&lt;/strong&gt;  I agree to execute promptly, both during and after the end of the Relationship, any proper oath, and to verify any proper document, required to carry out the terms of this Agreement, upon the Company’s written request to do so.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;No Conflicts.&lt;/strong&gt;  I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement does not and will not breach any agreement I have entered into, or will enter into, with any third party, including without limitation any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information or materials acquired by me in confidence or in trust prior to or during the Relationship.  I will not disclose to the Company or use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information or material belonging to any previous client, employer or any other party.  I will not induce the Company to use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information, or material belonging to any previous client, employer or any other party.  I acknowledge and agree that I have listed on Exhibit A all agreements (e.g., non-competition agreements, non-solicitation of customers agreements, non-solicitation of employees agreements, confidentiality agreements, inventions agreements, etc.), if any, with a current or former client, employer, or any other person or entity, that may restrict my ability to accept employment with the Company or my ability to recruit or engage customers or service providers on behalf of the Company, or otherwise relate to or restrict my ability to perform my duties for the Company or any obligation I may have to the Company.  I agree not to enter into any written or oral agreement that conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Voluntary Execution.&lt;/strong&gt;  I certify and acknowledge that I have carefully read all of the provisions of this Agreement, that I understand and have voluntarily accepted such provisions, and that I will fully and faithfully comply with such provisions.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;General Provisions.&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Governing Law.&lt;/strong&gt;  The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws. 
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Entire Agreement.&lt;/strong&gt;  This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Company and me relating to its subject matter and merges all prior discussions between us.  No amendment to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing signed by both parties to this Agreement.  The Company shall not be deemed hereby to have waived any rights or remedies it may have in law or equity, nor to have given any authorizations or waived any of its rights under this Agreement, unless, and only to the extent, it does so by a specific writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company, it being understood that, even if I am an officer of the Company, I will not have authority to give any such authorizations or waivers for the Company under this Agreement without specific approval by the Board of Directors.  Any subsequent change or changes in my duties, obligations, rights or compensation will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Severability.&lt;/strong&gt;  If one or more of the provisions in this Agreement are deemed void or unenforceable to any extent in any context, such provisions shall nevertheless be enforced to the fullest extent allowed by law in that and other contexts, and the validity and force of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected.   
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Successors and Assigns.&lt;/strong&gt;  This Agreement will be binding upon my heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives, and my successors and assigns, and will be for the benefit of the Company, its successors, and its assigns.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Remedies.&lt;/strong&gt;  I acknowledge and agree that violation of this Agreement by me may cause the Company irreparable harm, and therefore agree that the Company will be entitled to seek extraordinary relief in court, including, but not limited to, temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond or other security (or, where such a bond or security is required, I agree that a $1,000 bond will be adequate), in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Advice of Counsel.&lt;/strong&gt;  I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, IN EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, AND I HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AGAINST ANY PARTY BY REASON OF THE DRAFTING OR PREPARATION HEREOF.

&lt;strong&gt;EXHIBIT B&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Section 2870 of the California Labor Code is as follows:

(a)	Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer’s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those inventions that either:

&lt;ol class="levelone"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer; or
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Result from any work performed by the employee for the employer.
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

(b)	To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to require an employee to assign an invention otherwise excluded from being required to be assigned under subdivision (a), the provision is against the public policy of this state and is unenforceable.] 

&lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt;

RCW 49.44.140 of the Revised Code of Washington is as follows:

(1)	A provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign or offer to assign any of the employee’s rights in an invention to the employer does not apply to an invention for which no equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information of the employer was used and which was developed entirely on the employee’s own time, unless (a) the invention relates (i) directly to the business of the employer, or (ii) to the employer's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (b) the invention results from any work performed by the employee for the employer. Any provision which purports to apply to such an invention is to that extent against the public policy of this state and is to that extent void and unenforceable.

(2)	An employer shall not require a provision made void and unenforceable by subsection (1) of this section as a condition of employment or continuing employment.

(3)	If an employment agreement entered into after September 1, 1979, contains a provision requiring the employee to assign any of the employee’s rights in any invention to the employer, the employer must also, at the time the agreement is made, provide a written notification to the employee that the agreement does not apply to an invention for which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of the employer was used and which was developed entirely on the employee’s own time, unless (a) the invention relates (i) directly to the business of the employer, or (ii) to the employer's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (b) the invention results from any work performed by the employee for the employer.

TERMINATION CERTIFICATION&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

This is to certify that I do not have in my possession, nor have I failed to return, any devices, records, data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications, drawings, blueprints, sketches, laboratory notebooks, flow charts, materials, equipment, other documents or property, or copies or reproductions of any aforementioned items belonging to {{full_company_name}}, a Delaware corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns (collectively, the “Company”).

I further certify that I have complied with all the terms of the Company’s Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement signed by me, including the reporting of any Inventions (as defined therein), conceived or made by me (solely or jointly with others) covered by that agreement.

I further agree that, in compliance with the Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement, I will preserve as confidential all trade secrets, confidential knowledge, data or other proprietary information relating to products, processes, know-how, designs, formulas, developmental or experimental work, computer programs, data bases, other original works of authorship, customer lists, business plans, financial information or other subject matter pertaining to any business of the Company or any of its employees, clients, consultants or licensees.

Further, I agree that for {{confidentiality_period}}  months from the date of this Certification, I shall not use any Confidential Information of the Company to negatively influence any of the Company’s clients or customers from purchasing Company products or services or to solicit or influence or attempt to influence any client, customer or other person either directly or indirectly, to direct any purchase of products and/or services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or other entity in competition with the business of the Company.

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CONSULTING AGREEMENT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This Consulting Agreement (the “&lt;u&gt;Agreement&lt;/u&gt;”) is made as of {{date_agreement}}, by and between {{full_company_name}}, a Delaware corporation (the “&lt;u&gt;Company&lt;/u&gt;”), and {{consultant_name}} (“&lt;u&gt;Consultant&lt;/u&gt;”).
&lt;ol class="levelone"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
		&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Consulting Relationship.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  During the term of this Agreement, Consultant will provide consulting services to the Company as described on &lt;u&gt;Exhibit A &lt;/u&gt;hereto (the “&lt;u&gt;Services&lt;/u&gt;”).  Consultant represents that Consultant is duly licensed (as applicable) and has the qualifications, the experience and the ability to properly perform the Services.  Consultant shall use Consultant’s best efforts to perform the Services such that the results are satisfactory to the Company. Consultant shall devote at least {{consultant_time_option}} hours to performance of the Services.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
		&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fees&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;  As consideration for the Services to be provided by Consultant and other obligations, the Company shall pay to Consultant the amounts specified in &lt;u&gt;Exhibit B&lt;/u&gt; hereto at the times specified therein.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
		&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Expenses.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Consultant shall not be authorized to incur on behalf of the Company any expenses and will be responsible for all expenses incurred while performing the Services{{#if_eq expenses_allowed compare="1"}}, except as expressly specified in &lt;u&gt;Exhibit C&lt;/u&gt; hereto,{{/if_eq}} unless otherwise agreed to by the Company’s {{expense_approval}}, which consent shall be evidenced in writing for any expenses in excess of ${{expense_threshold}}.  As a condition to receipt of reimbursement, Consultant shall be required to submit to the Company reasonable evidence that the amount involved was both reasonable and necessary to the Services provided under this Agreement.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
		&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Term and Termination.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Consultant shall serve as a consultant to the Company for a period commencing on {{date_required}} and terminating on the earlier of (a) the date Consultant completes the provision of the Services to the Company under this Agreement, or (b) the date Consultant shall have been paid the maximum amount of consulting fees as provided in &lt;u&gt;Exhibit B&lt;/u&gt; hereto.&lt;br/&gt;Notwithstanding the above, either party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon {{termination_notice}} business days’ written notice.  In the event of such termination, Consultant shall be paid for any portion of the Services that have been performed prior to the termination. Should either party default in the performance of this Agreement or materially breach any of its obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to Consultant’s obligations under the Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement between the Company and Consultant referenced below, the non-breaching party may terminate this Agreement immediately if the breaching party fails to cure the breach within {{cure_period}} business days after having received written notice by the non-breaching party of the breach or default.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
		&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Independent Contractor.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Consultant’s relationship with the Company will be that of an independent contractor and not that of an employee.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
		&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Method of Provision of Services.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Consultant shall be solely responsible for determining the method, details and means of performing the Services.  Consultant may, at Consultant’s own expense, employ or engage the services of such employees, subcontractors, partners or agents, as Consultant deems necessary to perform the Services (collectively, the “&lt;u&gt;Assistants&lt;/u&gt;”).  The Assistants are not and shall not be employees of the Company, and Consultant shall be wholly responsible for the professional performance of the Services by the Assistants such that the results are satisfactory to the Company.  Consultant shall expressly advise the Assistants of the terms of this Agreement, and shall require each Assistant to execute and deliver to the Company a Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement substantially in the form attached to this Agreement as &lt;u&gt;Exhibit D&lt;/u&gt; hereto (the “&lt;u&gt;Confidentiality Agreement&lt;/u&gt;”).
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;No Authority to Bind Company.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Consultant acknowledges and agrees that Consultant and its Assistants have no authority to enter into contracts that bind the Company or create obligations on the part of the Company without the prior written authorization of the Company.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;No Benefits.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Consultant acknowledges and agrees that Consultant and its Assistants shall not be eligible for any Company employee benefits and, to the extent Consultant otherwise would be eligible for any Company employee benefits but for the express terms of this Agreement, Consultant (on behalf of itself and its employees) hereby expressly declines to participate in such Company employee benefits.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Withholding&lt;/u&gt;; &lt;u&gt;Indemnification.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Consultant shall have full responsibility for applicable withholding taxes for all compensation paid to Consultant or its Assistants under this Agreement, and for compliance with all applicable labor and employment requirements with respect to Consultant’s self-employment, sole proprietorship or other form of business organization, and with respect to the Assistants, including state worker’s compensation insurance coverage requirements and any U.S. immigration visa requirements.  Consultant agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Company harmless from any liability for, or assessment of, any claims or penalties with respect to such withholding taxes, labor or employment requirements, including any liability for, or assessment of, withholding taxes imposed on the Company by the relevant taxing authorities with respect to any compensation paid to Consultant or its Assistants.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Supervision of Consultant’s Services.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  All of the services to be performed by Consultant, including but not limited to the Services, will be as agreed between Consultant and the Company’s {{consultant_supervisor}}.  Consultant will be required to report to the {{consultant_supervisor}} concerning the Services performed under this Agreement.  The nature and frequency of these reports will be left to the discretion of the {{consultant_supervisor}}.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Consulting or Other Services for Competitors.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Consultant represents and warrants that Consultant does not presently perform or intend to perform, during the term of the Agreement, consulting or other services for, or engage in or intend to engage in an employment relationship with, companies who businesses or proposed businesses in any way involve products or services which would be competitive with the Company’s products or services, or those products or services proposed or in development by the Company during the term of the Agreement{{#if_eq competition compare="1"}} (except for those companies, if any, listed on &lt;u&gt;Exhibit E&lt;/u&gt; hereto){{/if_eq}}.  If, however, Consultant decides to do so, Consultant agrees that, in advance of accepting such work, Consultant will promptly notify the Company in writing, specifying the organization with which Consultant proposes to consult, provide services, or become employed by and to provide information sufficient to allow the Company to determine if such work would conflict with the terms of this Agreement, including the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the interests of the Company or further services which the Company might request of Consultant.  If the Company determines that such work conflicts with the terms of this Agreement, the Company reserves the right to terminate this Agreement immediately.  In no event shall any of the Services be performed for the Company at the facilities of a third party or using the resources of a third party.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Confidentiality Agreement.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Consultant shall sign, or has signed, a Confidentiality Agreement, on or before the date Consultant begins providing the Services.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Conflicts with this Agreement.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Consultant represents and warrants that neither Consultant nor any of the Assistants is under any pre-existing obligation in conflict or in any way inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement.  Consultant represents and warrants that Consultant’s performance of all the terms of this Agreement will not breach any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information acquired by Consultant in confidence or in trust prior to commencement of this Agreement.  Consultant warrants that Consultant has the right to disclose and/or or use all ideas, processes, techniques and other information, if any, which Consultant has gained from third parties, and which Consultant discloses to the Company or uses in the course of performance of this Agreement, without liability to such third parties.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Consultant agrees that Consultant shall not bundle with or incorporate into any deliveries provided to the Company herewith any third party products, ideas, processes, or other techniques, without the express, written prior approval of the Company.  Consultant represents and warrants that Consultant has not granted and will not grant any rights or licenses to any intellectual property or technology that would conflict with Consultant’s obligations under this Agreement.  Consultant will not knowingly infringe upon any copyright, patent, trade secret or other property right of any former client, employer or third party in the performance of the Services.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Miscellaneous.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
				&lt;ol class="levelthree"&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;mendments and Waivers.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Any term of this Agreement may be amended or waived only with the written consent of the Company.
					&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sole Agreement.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  This Agreement, including the Exhibits hereto, constitutes the sole agreement of the parties and supersedes all oral negotiations and prior writings with respect to the subject matter hereof.
					&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Notices.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Any notice required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient upon delivery, when delivered personally or by overnight courier or sent by email or fax (upon customary confirmation of receipt), or forty-eight (48) hours after being deposited in the U.S. mail as certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the party to be notified at such party’s address or fax number as set forth on the signature page or as subsequently modified by written notice. 
					&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Choice of Law.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of {{state_laws}}, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.
					&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Severability.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to be unenforceable under applicable law, the parties agree to renegotiate such provision in good faith.  In the event that the parties cannot reach a mutually agreeable and enforceable replacement for such provision, then (i) such provision shall be excluded from this Agreement, (ii) the balance of the Agreement shall be interpreted as if such provision were so excluded and (iii) the balance of the Agreement shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.
					&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Counterparts.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

					&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Advice of Counsel.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, IN EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, SUCH PARTY HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, AND HAS READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

Dear {{employee_name}},

{{full_company_name}}, a {{state}} corporation (the “&lt;u&gt;Company&lt;/u&gt;”), is pleased to offer you employment with the Company on the terms described below.
&lt;ol class="levelone"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
		&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Position.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  You will start in a full-time position as {{job_title}} and you will initially report to the Company’s {{employee_report}}.  Your primary duties will be {{employee_resp}}.  By signing this letter, you confirm with the Company that you are under no contractual or other legal obligations that would prohibit you from performing your duties with the Company.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
		&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Compensation {{#if_eq employee_benefits compare="1"}} and Employee Benefits.{{/if_eq}}&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  You will be paid a starting salary at the rate of ${{base_salary}} per {{payment_installments}}, payable on the Company’s regular payroll dates. {{#if_eq employee_benefits compare="1"}} As a regular employee of the Company you will be eligible to participate in a number of Company-sponsored benefits, which are described in the employee benefit summary that I have enclosed with this letter.{{/if_eq}} 
	&lt;/li&gt;
	{{#if_eq stock_options compare="1"}}
	&lt;li&gt; 
		&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stock Options.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors, you will be granted an option to purchase {{stock_option}} shares of the Company’s common stock.  The option will be subject to the terms and conditions applicable to options granted under the Company’s {{company_stock_plan}}, as described in that plan and the applicable stock option agreement, which you will be required to sign. You will vest in {{stock_option_percentage}}% of the option shares on the {{initial_vest_date}} month anniversary of your vesting commencement date and {{stock_option_fraction}}% of the total option shares will vest in {{stock_option_interval}} installments thereafter during continuous service, as described in the applicable stock option agreement. The exercise price per share will be equal to the fair market value per share on the date the option is granted, as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors in good faith compliance with applicable guidance in order to avoid having the option be treated as deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  There is no guarantee that the Internal Revenue Service will agree with this value.  You should consult with your own tax advisor concerning the tax risks associated with accepting an option to purchase the Company’s common stock.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	{{/if_eq}}
	&lt;li&gt; 
		&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Like all Company employees, you will be required, as a condition of your employment with the Company, to sign the Company’s enclosed standard Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
		&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Employment Relationship.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Employment with the Company is for no specific period of time.  Your employment with the Company will be “at will,” meaning that either you or the Company may terminate your employment at any time and for any reason, with or without cause.  Any contrary representations which may have been made to you are superseded by this offer.  This is the full and complete agreement between you and the Company on this term.  Although your job duties, title, compensation and benefits, as well as the Company’s personnel policies and procedures, may change from time to time, the “at will” nature of your employment may only be changed in an express written agreement signed by you and the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
		&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Outside Activities.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  While you render services to the Company, you agree that you will not engage in any other employment, consulting or other business activity without the written consent of the Company.  In addition, while you render services to the company, you will not assist any person or entity in competing with the Company, in preparing to compete with the Company or in hiring any employees or consultants of the Company.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
		&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Withholding Taxes.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  All forms of compensation referred to in this letter are subject to applicable withholding and payroll taxes.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
		&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Entire Agreement.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  This letter supersedes and replaces any prior understandings or agreements, whether oral, written or implied, between you and the Company regarding the matters described in this letter.
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Signature Page Follows]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

If you wish to accept this offer, please sign and date both the enclosed duplicate original of this letter and the enclosed Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement and return them to me.  As required, by law, your employment with the Company is also contingent upon your providing legal proof of your identity and authorization to work in the United States. This offer, if not accepted, will expire at the close of business on {{final_signing_date}}.

We look forward to having you join us no later than {{date_required}}.

Very truly yours,

The exercise price per share will be equal to the fair market value per share on the date the Option is granted, as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors in good faith compliance with applicable guidance in order to avoid having the Option be treated as deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. There is no guarantee that the Internal Revenue Service will agree with this value. You should consult with your own tax advisor concerning the tax risks associated with accepting an option to purchase the Company’s Common Stock.

[The Option shall be immediately exercisable, but the purchased shares shall be subject to repurchase by the Company at the exercise price in the event that your services to the Company terminate before the purchased shares become vested.] So long as your service status is continuous, the Option shall vest [and become exercisable] as follows: [# of option shares] of the total number of option shares shall vest [and become exercisable] on [Option Exerciseable Date] and 1/48th of the total Option shares shall vest [and become exercisable] in equal monthly installments thereafter. The Option will be an incentive stock option to the maximum extent allowed by the tax code and shall be subject to the other terms and conditions set forth in the Company’s [Stock Plan Name] (the “&lt;u&gt;Stock Plan&lt;/u&gt;”) and in the Company's standard form of Stock Option Agreement (the “&lt;u&gt;Stock Agreement&lt;/u&gt;”).

Indemnification Agreement&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

This Indemnification Agreement (this “&lt;u&gt;Agreement&lt;/u&gt;”) is made as of {{date_agreement}}, by and between {{full_company_name}}, a Delaware corporation (the “&lt;u&gt;Company&lt;/u&gt;”), and {{employee_name}} (“&lt;u&gt;Indemnitee&lt;/u&gt;”).
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;RECITALS&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The Company and Indemnitee recognize the increasing difficulty in obtaining liability insurance for directors, officers and key employees, the significant increases in the cost of such insurance and the general reductions in the coverage of such insurance.  The Company and Indemnitee further recognize the substantial increase in corporate litigation in general, subjecting directors, officers and key employees to expensive litigation risks at the same time as the availability and coverage of liability insurance has been severely limited.  Indemnitee does not regard the current protection available as adequate under the present circumstances, and Indemnitee may not be willing to continue to serve in Indemnitee’s current capacity with the Company without additional protection.  The Company desires to attract and retain the services of highly qualified individuals, such as Indemnitee, and to indemnify its directors, officers and key employees so as to provide them with the maximum protection permitted by law.
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;AGREEMENT&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

In consideration of the mutual promises made in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company and Indemnitee hereby agree as follows:

&lt;ol class="levelone"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Indemnification.&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Third-Party Proceedings.&lt;/strong&gt;  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee, if Indemnitee was, is or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant (as a witness or otherwise) in any Proceeding (other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in the Company’s favor), against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and, in the case of a criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe Indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Proceedings By or in the Right of the Company.&lt;/strong&gt;  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee, if Indemnitee was, is or is threatened to be made a party to or a participant (as a witness or otherwise) in any Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in the Company’s favor, against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been finally adjudicated by court order or judgment to be liable to the Company unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such Proceeding is or was pending shall determine upon application that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall deem proper.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Success on the Merits.&lt;/strong&gt;  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding referred to in Section 1(a) or Section 1(b) or the defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, in whole or in part, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection therewith.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if Indemnitee is successful on the merits or otherwise as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in a Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such successfully resolved claims, issues or matters to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.  If any Proceeding is disposed of on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (1) the disposition being adverse to Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that Indemnitee was liable to the Company, (iii) a plea of guilty by Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and (v) with respect to any criminal Proceeding, an adjudication that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe Indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful, Indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Witness Expenses.&lt;/strong&gt;  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent that Indemnitee is a witness or otherwise asked to participate in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not a party, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Indemnification Procedure.&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Advancement of Expenses.&lt;/strong&gt;  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall advance all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Company of a statement requesting such advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of any Proceeding.  Such advances shall be unsecured and interest free and shall be made without regard to Indemnitee’s ability to repay the Expenses and without regard to Indemnitee’s ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the other provisions of this Agreement.  Indemnitee shall be entitled to continue to receive advancement of Expenses pursuant to this Section 2(a) unless and until the matter of Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification hereunder has been finally adjudicated by court order or judgment from which no further right of appeal exists.  Indemnitee hereby undertakes to repay such amounts advanced only if, and to the extent that, it ultimately is determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company under the other provisions of this Agreement.  Indemnitee shall qualify for advances upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, which shall constitute the requisite undertaking with respect to repayment of advances made hereunder and no other form of undertaking shall be required to qualify for advances made hereunder other than the execution of this Agreement.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Notice and Cooperation by Indemnitee.&lt;/strong&gt;  Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Company in writing upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information or other document relating to any Proceeding or matter for which indemnification will or could be sought under this Agreement.  Such notice to the Company shall include a description of the nature of, and facts underlying, the Proceeding, shall be directed to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and shall be given in accordance with the provisions of Section 13(d) below.  In addition, Indemnitee shall give the Company such additional information and cooperation as the Company may reasonably request.  Indemnitee’s failure to so notify, provide information and otherwise cooperate with the Company shall not relieve the Company of any obligation which it may have to Indemnitee under this Agreement, except to the extent that the Company is adversely affected by such failure.
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Determination of Entitlement.&lt;/strong&gt;  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, no determination as to entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of the Proceeding.  Subject to the foregoing, promptly after receipt of a statement requesting payment with respect to the indemnification rights set forth in Section 1, to the extent required by applicable law, the Company shall take the steps necessary to authorize such payment in the manner set forth in Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.  The Company shall pay any claims made under this Agreement, under any statute, or under any provision of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws providing for indemnification or advancement of Expenses, within thirty(30) days after a written request for payment thereof has first been received by the Company, and if such claim is not paid in full within such thirty (30) day-period, Indemnitee may, but need not, at any time thereafter bring an action against the Company in the Delaware Court of Chancery to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, subject to Section 12, Indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid for all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with bringing such action.  It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for advancement of Expenses under Section 2(a)) that Indemnitee has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under applicable law for the Company to indemnify Indemnitee for the amount claimed.  In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption with clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.  The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, or, in the case of a criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful.  In addition, it is the parties’ intention that if the Company contests Indemnitee’s right to indemnification, the question of Indemnitee’s right to indemnification shall be for the court to decide, and neither the failure of the Company (including its Board of Directors, any committee or subgroup of the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination that indemnification of Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct required by applicable law, nor an actual determination by the Company (including its Board of Directors, any committee or subgroup of the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that Indemnitee has or has not met the applicable standard of conduct.  If any requested determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder has not been made within ninety (90) days after the final disposition of the Proceeding, the requisite determination that Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Payment Directions.&lt;/strong&gt;  To the extent payments are required to be made hereunder, the Company shall, in accordance with Indemnitee’s request (but without duplication), (i) pay such Expenses on behalf of Indemnitee, (b) advance to Indemnitee funds in an amount sufficient to pay such Expenses, or (c) reimburse Indemnitee for such Expenses.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Notice to Insurers.&lt;/strong&gt;  If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof, the Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such Proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies.  The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;	
				&lt;strong&gt;Defense of Claim and Selection of Counsel.&lt;/strong&gt;  In the event the Company shall be obligated under Section 2(a) hereof to advance Expenses with respect to any Proceeding, the Company, if appropriate, shall be entitled to assume the defense of such Proceeding, with counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee, upon the delivery to Indemnitee of written notice of its election so to do.  After delivery of such notice, approval of such counsel by Indemnitee and the retention of such counsel by the Company, the Company will not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any fees of counsel subsequently incurred by Indemnitee with respect to the same Proceeding, provided that (i) Indemnitee shall have the right to employ counsel in any such Proceeding at Indemnitee’s expense; and (ii) if (A) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been previously authorized by the Company, (B) Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense or (C) the Company shall not, in fact, have employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding, then the fees and expenses of Indemnitee’s counsel shall be at the expense of the Company.  In addition, if there exists a potential, but not an actual conflict of interest between the Company and Indemnitee, the actual and reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by Indemnitee for separate counsel retained by Indemnitee to monitor the Proceeding (so that such counsel may assume Indemnitee’s defense if the conflict of interest between the Company and Indemnitee becomes an actual conflict of interest) shall be deemed to be Expenses that are subject to indemnification hereunder.  The existence of an actual or potential conflict of interest, and whether such conflict may be waived, shall be determined pursuant to the rules of attorney professional conduct and applicable law.  The Company shall not be required to obtain the consent of Indemnitee for the settlement of any Proceeding the Company has undertaken to defend if the Company assumes full and sole responsibility for each such settlement; provided, however, that the Company shall be required to obtain Indemnitee’s prior written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, before entering into any settlement which (1) does not grant Indemnitee a complete release of liability, (2) would impose any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee, or (3) would admit any liability or misconduct by Indemnitee.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Additional Indemnification Rights.&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Scope.&lt;/strong&gt;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law, notwithstanding that such indemnification is not specifically authorized by the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, the Company’s Bylaws or by statute.  In the event of any change, after the date of this Agreement, in any applicable law, statute, or rule which expands the right of a Delaware corporation to indemnify a member of its board of directors or an officer, such changes shall be deemed to be within the purview of Indemnitee’s rights and the Company’s obligations under this Agreement.  In the event of any change in any applicable law, statute or rule which narrows the right of a Delaware corporation to indemnify a member of its board of directors or an officer, such changes, to the extent not otherwise required by such law, statute or rule to be applied to this Agreement shall have no effect on this Agreement or the parties’ rights and obligations hereunder. 
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Nonexclusivity.&lt;/strong&gt;  The indemnification provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any rights to which Indemnitee may be entitled under the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, its Bylaws, any agreement, any vote of stockholders or disinterested members of the Company’s Board of Directors, the General Corporation Law of Delaware, or otherwise, both as to action in Indemnitee’s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Interest on Unpaid Amounts.&lt;/strong&gt;  If any payment to be made by the Company to Indemnitee hereunder is delayed by more than ninety (90) days from the date the duly prepared request for such payment is received by the Company, interest shall be paid by the Company to Indemnitee at the legal rate under Delaware law for amounts which the Company indemnifies or is obligated to indemnify for the period commencing with the date on which Indemnitee actually incurs such Expense or pays such judgment, fine or amount in settlement and ending with the date on which such payment is made to Indemnitee by the Company.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;[Information Sharing.&lt;/strong&gt;  If Indemnitee is the subject of or is implicated in any way during an investigation, whether formal or informal, the Company shall share with Indemnitee any information the Company has furnished to any third parties concerning the investigation provided that, at the time such information is so furnished to such third party, Indemnitee continues to serve in one or more capacities giving rise to the Company’s indemnification obligations under Section 1.&lt;strong&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;[Third-Party Indemnification.&lt;/strong&gt;  The Company hereby acknowledges that Indemnitee has or may from time to time obtain certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by one or more third parties (collectively, the “&lt;u&gt;Third-Party Indemnitors&lt;/u&gt;”).  The Company hereby agrees that it is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to Indemnitee are primary and any obligation of the Third-Party Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by Indemnitee are secondary), and that the Company will not assert that the Indemnitee must seek expense advancement or reimbursement, or indemnification, from any Third-Party Indemnitor before the Company must perform its expense advancement and reimbursement, and indemnification obligations, under this Agreement.  No advancement or payment by the Third-Party Indemnitors on behalf of Indemnitee with respect to any claim for which Indemnitee has sought indemnification from the Company shall affect the foregoing.  The Third-Party Indemnitors shall be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery which Indemnitee would have had against the Company if the Third-Party Indemnitors had not advanced or paid any amount to or on behalf of Indemnitee.  If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Third-Party Indemnitors are not entitled to the subrogation rights described in the preceding sentence, the Third-Party Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution by the Company to the Third-Party Indemnitors with respect to any advance or payment by the Third-Party Indemnitors to or on behalf of the Indemnitee.&lt;strong&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;[Indemnification of Venture Capital Funds.&lt;/strong&gt;  If (i) Indemnitee is or was affiliated with one or more venture capital funds that has invested in the Company (each a “VC Fund”), (ii) a VC Fund is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant (including as a witness) in any proceeding, and (iii) the VC Fund’s involvement in the proceeding is related to Indemnitee’s service to the Company as a director of the Company, then the VC Fund shall be entitled to all of the indemnification rights and remedies under this Agreement to the same extent as Indemnitee.&lt;strong&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Partial Indemnification.&lt;/strong&gt;  If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of the Expenses, judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred in connection with a Proceeding, but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion of such Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement to which Indemnitee is entitled.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Director and Officer Liability Insurance.&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;D&amp;amp;O Policy.&lt;/strong&gt;  The Company shall, from time to time, make the good faith determination whether or not it is practicable for the Company to obtain and maintain a policy or policies of insurance with reputable insurance companies providing the directors and officers of the Company with coverage for losses from wrongful acts, or to ensure the Company’s performance of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement.  Among other considerations, the Company will weigh the costs of obtaining such insurance coverage against the protection afforded by such coverage.  In all policies of director and officer liability insurance, Indemnitee shall be named as an insured in such a manner as to provide Indemnitee the same rights and benefits as are accorded to the most favorably insured of the Company’s directors, if Indemnitee is a director; or of the Company’s officers, if Indemnitee is not a director of the Company but is an officer; or of the Company’s key employees, if Indemnitee is not an officer or director but is a key employee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no obligation to obtain or maintain such insurance if the Company determines in good faith that such insurance is not reasonably available, if the premium costs for such insurance are disproportionate to the amount of coverage provided, if the coverage provided by such insurance is limited by exclusions so as to provide an insufficient benefit, or if Indemnitee is covered by similar insurance maintained by a parent or subsidiary of the Company.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Tail Coverage.&lt;/strong&gt;  In the event of a Change of Control or the Company’s becoming insolvent (including being placed into receivership or entering the federal bankruptcy process and the like), the Company shall maintain in force any and all insurance policies then maintained by the Company in providing insurance (directors’ and officers’ liability, fiduciary, employment practices or otherwise) in respect of Indemnitee, for a period of six years thereafter.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Severability.&lt;/strong&gt;  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to require or shall be construed as requiring the Company to do or fail to do any act in violation of applicable law.  The Company’s inability, pursuant to court order, to perform its obligations under this Agreement shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement.  If this Agreement or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Agreement that shall not have been invalidated, and the balance of this Agreement not so invalidated shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Exclusions.&lt;/strong&gt;  Any other provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement:
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Claims Initiated by Indemnitee.&lt;/strong&gt;  To indemnify or advance Expenses to Indemnitee with respect to Proceedings initiated or brought voluntarily by Indemnitee and not by way of defense, except with respect to Proceedings brought to establish, enforce or interpret a right to indemnification under this Agreement or any other statute or law or otherwise as required under Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, but such indemnification or advancement of Expenses may be provided by the Company in specific cases if the Board of Directors finds it to be appropriate; provided, however, that the exclusion set forth in the first clause of this subsection shall not be deemed to apply to any investigation initiated or brought by Indemnitee to the extent reasonably necessary or advisable in support of Indemnitee’s defense of a Proceeding to which Indemnitee was, is or is threatened to be made, a party;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Good Faith.&lt;/strong&gt;  To indemnify Indemnitee for any Expenses incurred by Indemnitee with respect to any Proceeding instituted by Indemnitee to establish, enforce or interpret a right to indemnification under this Agreement or any other statute or law or otherwise as required under Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that each of the material assertions made by Indemnitee in such proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Insured Claims.&lt;/strong&gt;  To indemnify Indemnitee for Expenses to the extent such Expenses have been paid directly to Indemnitee by an insurance carrier under an insurance policy maintained by the Company; or
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Certain Exchange Act Claims.&lt;/strong&gt;  To indemnify Indemnitee in connection with any claim made against Indemnitee for (i) an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale (or sale and purchase) by Indemnitee of securities of the Company within the meaning of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or any similar successor statute or any similar provisions of state statutory law or common law, or (ii) any reimbursement of the Company by Indemnitee of any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation or of any profits realized by Indemnitee from the sale of securities of the Company, as required in each case under the Exchange Act (including any such reimbursements that arise from an accounting restatement of the Company pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), or the payment to the Company of profits arising from the purchase and sale by Indemnitee of securities in violation of Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act); provided, however, that to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent Indemnitee is successful on the merits or otherwise with respect to any such Proceeding, the Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any such Proceeding shall be deemed to be Expenses that are subject to indemnification hereunder.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Contribution Claims.&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				If the indemnification provided in Section 1 is unavailable in whole or in part and may not be paid to Indemnitee for any reason other than those set forth in Section 7, then in respect to any Proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, shall pay, in the first instance, the entire amount incurred by Indemnitee, whether for Expenses, judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement, in connection with any Proceeding without requiring Indemnitee to contribute to such payment, and the Company hereby waives and relinquishes any right of contribution it may have at any time against Indemnitee.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				With respect to a Proceeding brought against directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company (other than Indemnitee), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee from any claims for contribution that may be brought by any such directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company (other than Indemnitee) who may be jointly liable with Indemnitee, to the same extent Indemnitee would have been entitled to such indemnification under this Agreement if such Proceeding had been brought against Indemnitee.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;No Imputation.&lt;/strong&gt;  The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Company or the Company itself shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining any rights under this Agreement.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Determination of Good Faith.&lt;/strong&gt;  For purposes of any determination of good faith, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee’s action is based on the records or books of account of the Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or the Board of Directors of the Enterprise or any counsel selected by any committee of the Board of Directors of the Enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser, investment banker, compensation consultant, or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Enterprise or the Board of Directors of the Enterprise or any committee thereof.  The provisions of this Section 10 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct.  Whether or not the foregoing provisions of this Section are satisfied, it shall in any event be presumed that Indemnitee has at all times acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Defined Terms and Phrases.&lt;/strong&gt;  For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
		&lt;ol class="leveltwo"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				“&lt;u&gt;Beneficial Owner&lt;/u&gt;” and “&lt;u&gt;Beneficial Ownership&lt;/u&gt;” shall have the meanings set forth in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act as in effect on the date hereof.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				“&lt;u&gt;Change of Control&lt;/u&gt;” shall be deemed to occur upon the earliest of any of the following events:
				&lt;ol class="levelthree"&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Acquisition of Stock by Third Party.  Any Person is or becomes the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, unless (1) the change in the relative Beneficial Ownership of the Company’s securities by any Person results solely from a reduction in the aggregate number of outstanding shares of securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, or (2) such acquisition was approved in advance by the Continuing Directors and such acquisition would not constitute a Change of Control under part (iii) of this definition.
					&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Change in Board of Directors.  Individuals who, as of the date of this Agreement, constitute the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), and any new director whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company’s stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors on the date of this Agreement (collectively, the “Continuing Directors”), cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the members of the Board.
					&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Corporate Transaction.  The effective date of a reorganization, merger, or consolidation of the Company (a “Business Combination”), in each case, unless, following such Business Combination:  (1) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the Beneficial Owners of securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 51% of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors resulting from such Business Combination (including a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns the Company or all or substantially all of the Company’s assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Business Combination, of the securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors and with the power to elect at least a majority of the Board or other governing body of the surviving entity; (2) no Person (excluding any corporation resulting from such Business Combination) is the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of 15% or more of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of such corporation except to the extent that such ownership existed prior to the Business Combination; and (3) at least a majority of the Board of Directors of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination were Continuing Directors at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board of Directors, providing for such Business Combination.
					&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Liquidation.  The approval by the Company’s stockholders of a complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement or series of agreements for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, other than factoring the Company’s current receivables or escrows due (or, if such approval is not required, the decision by the Board to proceed with such a liquidation, sale or disposition in one transaction or a series of related transactions).
					&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Other Events.  There occurs any other event of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A (or a response to any similar item or any similar schedule or form) promulgated under the Exchange Act whether or not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement.
					&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ol&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				“&lt;u&gt;Company&lt;/u&gt;” shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that if Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other enterprise, Indemnitee shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Agreement with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as Indemnitee would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				“&lt;u&gt;Enterprise&lt;/u&gt;” means the Company and any other enterprise that Indemnitee was or is serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, partner (general, limited or otherwise), member (managing or otherwise), trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				“&lt;u&gt;Exchange Act&lt;/u&gt;” means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				“&lt;u&gt;Expenses&lt;/u&gt;” shall include all direct and indirect costs, fees and expenses of any type or nature whatsoever, including all attorneys’ fees and costs, retainers, court costs, transcript costs, fees of experts, witness fees, travel expenses, fees of private investigators and professional advisors, duplicating costs, printing and binding costs, telephone charges, postage, delivery service fees, any federal, state, local or foreign taxes imposed on Indemnitee as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of any payment under this Agreement (including taxes that may be imposed upon the actual or deemed receipt of payments under this Agreement with respect to the imposition of federal, state, local or foreign taxes), fax transmission charges, secretarial services and all other disbursements, obligations or expenses in connection with prosecuting, defending, preparing to prosecute or defend, investigating, being or preparing to be a witness in, settlement or appeal of, or otherwise participating in a Proceeding.  Expenses also shall include any of the forgoing expenses incurred in connection with any appeal resulting from any Proceeding, including the principal, premium, security for, and other costs relating to any costs bond, supersedes bond, or other appeal bond or its equivalent.  Expenses also shall include any interest, assessment or other charges imposed thereon and costs incurred in preparing statements in support of payment requests hereunder.  Expenses, however, shall not include amounts paid in settlement by Indemnitee or the amount of judgments or fines against Indemnitee.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				“&lt;u&gt;Person&lt;/u&gt;” shall have the meaning as set forth in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act as in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that “Person” shall exclude: (i) the Company; (ii) any direct or indirect majority owned subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any employee benefit plan of the Company or any direct or indirect majority owned subsidiaries of the Company or of any corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company’s stockholders in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company (an “Employee Benefit Plan”); and (iv) any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an Employee Benefit Plan.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				“&lt;u&gt;Proceeding&lt;/u&gt;” shall include any actual, threatened, pending or completed action, suit, arbitration, mediation, alternate dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, inquiry, administrative hearing or any other actual, threatened or completed proceeding, whether brought by a third party, a government agency, the Company or its Board of Directors or a committee thereof, whether in the right of the Company or otherwise and whether of a civil (including intentional or unintentional tort claims), criminal, administrative, legislative or investigative (formal or informal) nature, including any appeal therefrom, in which Indemnitee was, is, will or might be involved as a party, potential party, non-party witness or otherwise by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, by reason of any action (or failure to act) taken by Indemnitee or of any action (or failure to act) on Indemnitee’s part while acting as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, partner (general, limited or otherwise), member (managing or otherwise), trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other enterprise, in each case whether or not serving in such capacity at the time any liability or expense is incurred for which indemnification, reimbursement or advancement of expenses can be provided under this Agreement.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				In addition, references to “other enterprise” shall include another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or any other enterprise; references to “fines” shall include any excise taxes assessed on Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan; references to “serving at the request of the Company” shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company which imposes duties on, or involves services by Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in a manner “not opposed to the best interests of the Company” as referred to in this Agreement; references to “include” or “including” shall mean include or including, without limitation; and references to Sections, paragraphs or clauses are to Sections, paragraphs or clauses in this Agreement unless otherwise specified.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;

			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;

{{employee_address}}
&lt;br/&gt;
{{date_agreement}}
&lt;br/&gt;
Dear {{employee_name}},
&lt;br/&gt;
Further to our discussions, this letter outlines the proposal to you from {{full_company_name}} Limited (the "&lt;strong&gt;Company&lt;/strong&gt;") regarding the grant of share options. Any grant which is made to you will be subject to the Company's share option scheme as and when that is put in place.
&lt;br/&gt;
Currently, it is not intended to put in place an option scheme until after the Company concludes a Series {{financing_option}} financing, or any other type of fundraising/event. This may not be for some time. Only after an option scheme is adopted can you be granted options. Note that you will need to be an employee of the Company at the time options are granted. Thus, if you cease to be an employee of the Company (for any reason) before the grant date or if you are under notice of termination of employment whether by you or the Company, you will not be granted options.
&lt;br/&gt;
Following the Company's establishment of a share option scheme, and subject to the conditions above and the approval of the board of directors of the Company (the "&lt;strong&gt;Board&lt;/strong&gt;"), you will be granted an option (the "&lt;strong&gt;Option&lt;/strong&gt;") to acquire {{stock_option}} ordinary shares (the "&lt;strong&gt;Shares&lt;/strong&gt;").
&lt;br/&gt;
The basic terms of the Option which, subject to Board approval, will be granted to you following the establishment of the Company's share option scheme will be as follows:
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ol class="indent-only"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The exercise price per Share of the Option will be such amount as determined by the Board in good faith equal to the market value per Share on the date the Option is granted {{#if_eq hm_customs_value compare=1}}with the intention being that agreement as to this value will be obtained in advance from HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs.{{/if_eq}} {{#if_eq hm_customs_value compare=0}}although, there is no guarantee that HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs will agree with this valuation.{{/if_eq}}
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The term of the Option will be for a maximum of ten years from the date of grant of the Option, subject to earlier expiration in the event of the termination by you or the Company of your continuous employment with the Company (for whatever reason, whether lawful or unlawful). The Option will be subject always to the terms and conditions of the share option scheme rules and the option agreement.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		{{stock_option_percentage}} per cent. of the Option will vest on the {{initial_vest_date}} anniversary of the date on which the Option is granted with the remainder vesting in equal monthly instalments over the following {{stock_option_interval}} month(s). In no circumstances can the Option vest in respect of a greater number of shares than the number in respect of which the Option was originally granted.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		No part of the Option shall vest following the termination of your employment, howsoever arising. If, after the Option has been granted, you cease to be an employee in circumstances in which you are a "Bad Leaver", then all vested and unvested options will lapse immediately. If you leave and you are a "Good Leaver" then you will be able to exercise the Option to the extent vested for a limited period of time following your ceasing to be an employee. Details of the circumstances constituting "good" and "bad" leaving will be set out in the share option scheme rules once that has been established. Please note that the "Good Leaver/Bad Leaver" concepts will be determined, in conjunction with investors, at the time a share option scheme is implemented.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You will be responsible for, and required to indemnify the Company [and all group companies] against, all and any liability to taxation or social security contributions (both employee's and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, employer's national insurance contributions) arising from the grant, vesting, holding or exercise of the Option or any shares underlying the Option. Please note that the Company is not and will not provide tax or social security advice to you. If you are in any doubt as to your tax and/or social security position you should consult an appropriately qualified independent professional adviser immediately.
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please note that the grant of the Option will be separate to your employment contract with the Company, and will not form part of your terms and conditions of employment. Your rights, if any, in respect of or in connection with the Option are derived solely from the discretionary decision of the Company to permit you to participate in the share option scheme and to benefit from a discretionary Option award.
&lt;br/&gt;
Yours sincerely,
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

			&lt;br/&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Demand Registration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:  Beginning on the 5th anniversary of the Closing, or six months after the IPO, whichever is earlier, 2 demand registrations of at least $5,000,000 each, upon initiation by holders of at least 51% of the outstanding Registrable Securities.
