The Deposit Protection Service - This is the only custodial scheme and is free to use. The tenant pays the deposit to the landlord, who then pays it into the scheme. At the end of the tenancy, if the landlord and tenant agree how the deposit should be repaid, they will tell the scheme administrator who will pay out the money as agreed, plus any interest earned. If there is a dispute, the scheme will continue to hold the disputed amount until dispute resolution or a court decides what is fair. The scheme administrator will then divide and return the disputed amount based on the dispute resolution's or court's decision. For more information see  HYPERLINK "http://www.depositprotection.com" http://www.depositprotection.com.

My Deposits - This is an insurance-based scheme. The landlord must apply to the scheme to become a member and there is a fee. The tenant pays the deposit to the landlord who holds the deposit and notifies the scheme administrator that they have the deposit and that it should be protected. At the end of the tenancy the landlord and tenant will agree what happens to the deposit.  If there is a dispute, the landlord will be required to lodge the disputed amount with the scheme administrator within 14 days. When the dispute is resolved, the lodged money will be repaid to the landlord and tenant in accordance with agreement, dispute resolution, or court order. If the landlord fails to lodge the disputed amount with the scheme administrator, insurance arrangements will ensure the return of the disputed amount to the tenant when they are entitled to it, and recover the amount from the landlord. For more information see  HYPERLINK "http://www.mydeposits.co.uk" www.mydeposits.co.uk.

The Tenancy Deposit Scheme (TDS) - This is an insurance-based scheme. The landlord must apply to the scheme to become a member and there is a fee. The tenant pays the deposit to the landlord who holds the deposit and notifies the scheme administrator that they have the deposit and that it should be protected.

If there is a dispute, the landlord will be required to lodge the disputed amount with the scheme administrator within 14 days. When the dispute is resolved, the lodged money will be repaid to the landlord and tenant in accordance with agreement, dispute resolution, or court order. If the landlord fails to lodge the disputed amount with the scheme administrator, insurance arrangements will ensure the return of the disputed amount to the tenant when they are entitled to it, and recover the amount from the landlord.

Loan Agreement
===================================

THIS AGREEMENT is made on the {{#doc_var name="agreement_date" class="datepicker"}} DATE OF AGREEMENT {{/doc_var}} between

{{#doc_var name="first_party"}}NAME OF FIRST PARTY {{/doc_var}}  residing at  {{#doc_var name="first_party_address"}} ADDRESS OF FIRST PARTY{{/doc_var}} ("the Borrower"); and

{{#doc_var name="second_party"}}NAME OF SECOND PARTY {{/doc_var}}  residing at  {{#doc_var name="second_party_address"}} ADDRESS OF SECOND PARTY{{/doc_var}} ("the Borrower") ("the Lender")

WHEREAS:

The Lender has agreed to lend to the Borrower the sum of {{#doc_var name="loan_amount"}}loan amount{{/doc_var}} ("the Loan").

IT IS AGREED as follows:

On the execution of this Agreement the Lender agrees to make the Loan to the Borrower on the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

The Lender shall be entitled to call for repayment of the Loan on demand at any time but without prejudice to this entitlement shall accept repayment in the manner outlined below.

Interest on the Loan shall be calculated at a monthly rate of one twelfth of a nominal annual rate, the nominal annual rate being {{#doc_var name="interest_rate"}}INTEREST RATE{{/doc_var}} per cent per annum above the published annual base rate from time to time of the Bank of England, and shall be charged on the balance of the Loan outstanding on a monthly basis. Said interest shall be payable by the Borrower to the Lender monthly in arrears.

Repayment of the Loan shall be by monthly instalments in respect of principal and interest in the amount of {{#doc_var name="monthly_payment"}} MONTHLY AMOUNT {{/doc_var}} and shall be made by Bankerâ€™s Order, first payment due one month from the date of this Agreement. Such monthly payment shall be apportioned firstly towards payment of interest due and secondly towards repayment of the principal sum outstanding.

The monthly instalments of {{#doc_var name="monthly_payment"}} MONTHLY AMOUNT {{/doc_var}} have been calculated to allow the Loan and interest thereon to be repaid in full within {{#doc_var name="loan_term"}} LOAN TERM {{/doc_var}} months, assuming that the average annual base rate of interest is {{#doc_var name="interest_rate"}}INTEREST RATE{{/doc_var}} per cent above the published annual base rate of the Bank of England, per annum but the Lender gives no warranty as to the future level of said base rate.  The published base rate of said bank being {{#doc_var name="BASE_rate"}}BASE RATE{{/doc_var}} per cent as at the date on which this agreement is made.

If said base rate increases at any time after the date of this Agreement to a level which if continued for the remainder of the term of the Loan would mean that the monthly instalments of {{#doc_var name="monthly_payment"}} MONTHLY AMOUNT {{/doc_var}} are insufficient to repay the Loan and interest in full within {{#doc_var name="loan_term"}} LOAN TERM {{/doc_var}} months, then the Lender may by notice in writing to the Borrower require the Borrower to increase the monthly instalments to such a level as to allow the Loan and the interest thereon to be repaid within said {{#doc_var name="loan_term"}} LOAN TERM {{/doc_var}} months (to commence with the payment after such notice) or may extend the repayment period by mutual agreement.

If the base rate decreases at any time after the date of this Agreement then the monthly instalments shall be reduced to such a level as to allow the Loan and the interest thereon to be repaid within said {{#doc_var name="loan_term"}} LOAN TERM {{/doc_var}} months (to commence with the payment after such notice) or may reduce the repayment period to allow the Loan to be discharged prior to the expiration of the term of {{#doc_var name="loan_term"}} LOAN TERM {{/doc_var}} months by mutual agreement.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 5 the Borrower may repay the Loan and interest accrued thereon at any time after the date of this Agreement by giving {{#doc_var name="prepayment_penalty"}}NOTICE{{/doc_var}} monthsâ€™ notice in writing to the Lender or upon paying {{#doc_var name="prepayment_penalty"}}NOTICE{{/doc_var}} monthsâ€™ interest in lieu of notice.
