The tenant pays the deposit to the landlord, who then pays it into the scheme. At the end of the tenancy, if the landlord and tenant agree how the deposit should be repaid, they will tell the scheme administrator who will pay out the money as agreed, plus any interest earned. If there is a dispute, the scheme will continue to hold the disputed amount until dispute resolution or a court decides what is fair. The scheme administrator will then divide and return the disputed amount based on the dispute resolution's or court's decision. For more information see  HYPERLINK \"http://www.depositprotection.com\" http://www.depositprotection.com.\n\nMy Deposits - This is an insurance-based scheme. The landlord must apply to the scheme to become a member and there is a fee. The tenant pays the deposit to the landlord who holds the deposit and notifies the scheme administrator that they have the deposit and that it should be protected. At the end of the tenancy the landlord and tenant will agree what happens to the deposit.  If there is a dispute, the landlord will be required to lodge the disputed amount with the scheme administrator within 14 days. When the dispute is resolved, the lodged money will be repaid to the landlord and tenant in accordance with agreement, dispute resolution, or court order. If the landlord fails to lodge the disputed amount with the scheme administrator, insurance arrangements will ensure the return of the disputed amount to the tenant when they are entitled to it, and recover the amount from the landlord.
