Compensation is calculated by one of 2 methods, either indemnity or compensation and you are required to choose which option applies to this Agreement: Indemnity - where the Agent is entitled to a maximum of 1 year's commission (calculated by taking the annual average over the last 5 years of the agency or the whole Agreement if less than 5 years). The claim to an indemnity will only arise if it has been specifically agreed in the Agreement. Compensation - where the courts calculate compensation on the basis of damages the Agent suffers as a result of termination. Historically, the view has been taken in many first instance decisions that the Agent ought to be awarded compensation of 2 years' earnings if his agency is terminated, unless there is a good reason to depart from the 2 year presumption, which clearly made compensation more attractive to the Agent than indemnity, which is limited to one year and quite often is substantially less. However, in Lonsdale v Howard &amp; Hallam Ltd [2006] EWCA Civ 63 the Court of Appeal overturned these previous cases stating that all cases suggesting a presumption of 2 years' loss of earnings were wrongly decided and held that the correct measure of damages is the value of the agency business as at the date of termination, including whatever goodwill attaches to it. In short - a compensation claim is potentially unlimited and there could be huge awards for really valuable agencies, potentially well in excess of the 2 year compensation basis, whereas an indemnity provision gives a large degree of certainty since a claim can never exceed one year's commission.

If there is a dispute, the scheme will continue to hold the disputed amount until dispute resolution or a court decides what is fair.
