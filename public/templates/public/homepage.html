                        <p>I am a corporate, private equity, and transactions attorney based in SF. Previously, I practiced law for over 7 years with Gibson Dunn (which is consistently ranked in the top 15 corporate firms in the US and top 2 in CA).</p>
                        <p>I have worked with startups in the Bay Area for over 15 years, and I'm constantly amazed by the creativity and diversity of the founders that we work with.  It is a privilege helping them to change the world.</p>

Our workflow tools include a centralized checklist to help focus everyone on resolving open issues and closing the deal as quickly as possible.</p>

That's one less developer working for three months. With LawPal, you get the benefits of engaging a lawyer without writing a blank check  - No more “sticker shock” when the invoice arrives. </p>
